# Contribution
1. This repository stores Matlab code of our proposed blind source separation (BSS) algorithm, DUET_LSF, a method combining time-frequency masking and linear spatial filter (or beamforming). DUET_LSF is fast, analytical and performs better than some state-of-the-art BSS algorithms. The proposed algorithm can separate any number of speech sources using two microphones.

2. This repository also stores Matlab codes of all BSS algorithms we used as a comparison in our ICASSP 2022 paper "HARVESTING PARTIALLY-DISJOINT TIME-FREQUENCY INFORMATION FOR IMPROVING DEGENERATE UNMIXING ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE".

These BSS algorithms including
1. Degenerate unmixing estimation technique (DUET) (Rickard, 2007), a time-frequency masking-based method.
2. Independent vector analysis (IVA) (Kim et al., 2006), independent component analysis (ICA) based method.
3. Independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) (Kitamura et al., 2016), a method combining ICA and non-negative matrix factorazation (NMF).
4. Multi-channel non-nagetive factorization (MULTI_NMF) (Ozerov et al., 2010), NMF-based method.
4. Full-rank spatial model (FULLRANK) (Duong et al., 2010).
